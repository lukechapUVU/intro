1. List of files
-------------

this README.md file
index.html
index.css

2. Purpose
----------

To show competency in using git commands and managing a git repository.

3. How to config and run
------------------------

No need to config, simply run the html file.
If you are in VS Code, go to Run > Start Debugging > Select Environment (Chrome recommended), or you could use the shortcut F5.
If you are in an environment other than VS Code, then open the html file into a browser (Chrome recommended).

4. Choice of styling
--------------------

I chose to go with a black background with green text since it looks like a programming color palette.
